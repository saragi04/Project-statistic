## Code for statistic project about exponential distribution

In this code you will find a quick and efficient way to solve problems related to the exponential distribution, which involves calculating the probability of an event happening taking into account a variation rate (specifically time) of said event, graphing its density function to observe how its behavior is and finally calculate its mean and variance if necessary.
